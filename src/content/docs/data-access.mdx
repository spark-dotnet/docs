## Introduction
Since Blazor Spark uses Entity Framework, querying and saving models to your database is straight forward.

## Accessing the Database Context
In your razor components, you can inject the Database Context Factory at the top of your file.

Once injected, you can create a new context in your Razor code and run queries to retrieve models or save them to the database
```razor
@page "/developers"
@inject IDbContextFactory<DatabaseContext> factory

@code {

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    }
}
```
>
> Spark uses a DB Context Factory because Blazor applications do not create a service scope that aligns with the desired DB Context lifetime and will result in errors in your Blazor app.
> You can read more about this [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/dbcontext-configuration/#using-a-dbcontext-factory-eg-for-blazor).

## Querying Models
In your razor components, you can use LINQ to query models.

```razor
@page "/developers"
@inject IDbContextFactory<DatabaseContext> factory

<ul>
    @foreach (var developer in Developers) {
        <li>@developer.Name</li>
    }
</ul>

@code {
    private List<Developer> Developers = new List<Developer>();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        
        Developers = await db.Developers.ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

## Saving, Updating, and Deleting Data
Of course, when using Entity Framework, we don't only need to retrieve models from the database. We also need to insert, update, or delete records.

### Saving Models
Spark comes with handy extension method called `Save` to help you save a record in 1 line.
```razor
@page "/developers/create"
@inject IDbContextFactory<DatabaseContext> factory

<section>
    <h1>
        Create Developer
    </h1>
    <EditForm Model="NewDeveloper" OnValidSubmit="CreateDeveloper">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <InputText @bind-Value="Developer.Name" id="name" />
        <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </EditForm>
</section>

@code {
    public Developer NewDeveloper = new Developer();

    private void CreateDeveloper()
    {
        // save the new developer to the database
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        db.Developers.Save(NewDeveloper);
    }
}
```

The `Save` method is the equivalent to this code if you were using Entity Framework out of the box.
```csharp
private void CreateDeveloper()
{
    // Using the Save() extension method
    using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    db.Developers.Save(NewDeveloper);

    // Is Equivalent to this in standard Entity Framework
    using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    NewDeveloper.CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    db.Developers.Add(NewDeveloper);
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```

### Updating Models
Updating a record in a Razor component is similar to saving recirds. It can also take advantage of the `Save()` extension method, which will detect if it's an existing record for you.

```razor
@page "/developers/{id:int}/edit"
@inject IDbContextFactory<DatabaseContext> factory

<section>
    <h1>
        Edit Developer
    </h1>
    <EditForm Model="ExistingDeveloper" OnValidSubmit="EditDeveloper">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <InputText @bind-Value="Developer.Name" id="name" />
        <button type="submit">Update</button>
    </EditForm>
</section>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int id { get; set; }
    public Developer ExistingDeveloper = new Developer();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        ExistingDeveloper = await db.Developers.FindAsync(id)
    }
    
    private void EditDeveloper()
    {
        // update the existing developer in the database
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        db.Developers.Save(ExistingDeveloper);
    }
}
```

The `Save` method is the equivalent to this code if you were updating an existing record with Entity Framework out of the box.
```csharp
private void UpdateDeveloper()
{
    // Using the Save() extension method
    using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    db.Developers.Save(ExistingDeveloper);

    // Is Equivalent to this in standard Entity Framework
    using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    ExistingDeveloper.UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    db.Developers.Update(ExistingDeveloper);
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```

### Deleting Models
To delete a model, you can call the `Delete` extension method provided by Spark on a Database Context instance.
```razor
@page "/developers/{id:int}/delete"
@inject IDbContextFactory<DatabaseContext> factory

<section>
    <h1>
        Delete Developer
    </h1>
    <button type="button"  @onclick="DeleteDeveloper">Delete Developer</button>
</section>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public int id { get; set; }
    public Developer ExistingDeveloper = new Developer();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        ExistingDeveloper = await db.Developers.FindAsync(id)
    }
    
    private void DeleteDeveloper()
    {
        // delete the existing developer in the database
        using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
        db.Developers.Delete(ExistingDeveloper);
    }
}
```


The `Delete` method is the equivalent to this code if you were deleting an existing record with Entity Framework out of the box.
```csharp
private void DeleteDeveloper()
{
    // Using the Delete() extension method
    using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    db.Developers.Delete(ExistingDeveloper);

    // Is Equivalent to this in standard Entity Framework
    using var db = factory.CreateDbContext();
    db.Developers.Remove(ExistingDeveloper);
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```
