## Introduction

The Spark application structure is setup to give a consistant, organized project structure for your web application. 

## Application
The `Application` directory contains the core code of you application. 

### Database
The `Database` directory contains your `DbContext` and `Migrations` for EF Core.

### Events
The `Events` directory contains your event and listener classes. Events are used to alert other parts of your app that a given action has occurred. This provides great flexibility and decoupling.

### Mail
The `Mail` directory contains your mailable classes. Mailables are C# classes that represent a specific type of e-mail that you can send.

### Models
The `Models` directory contains your efcore model classes. Each database table for your application has a corresponding Model class that efcore will use to interact with that table.

### Services
The `Services` directory contains your services that can be Dependency Injected on startup. Services are typically used to abstract away business logic or database calls.

### Startup
The `Startup` directory contains Registration classes. These classes are where Sparks core services, custom services, events, or tasks are registered to the DI container. Scheduled jobs can also be registered here.

### Tasks
The `Tasks` directory contains queueable jobs for your application. Tasks can be scheduled or added to a background queue.

## Pages
The `Pages` directory contains your Blazor pages and components. This is where your sites frontend markdown and page logic will be contained. The inner `Shared` directory contains your re-usable Razor components. These components can be imported into your Blazor views and keep your front-end dry.

## Storage
The `Storage` directory contains your application logs if the Spark logger is setup to log to files. It also contains mail logs if your mailer is setup to log to files.

## wwwroot
The `wwwroot` directory contains your compiled CSS, images, and other frontend public dependancies you want to use.
