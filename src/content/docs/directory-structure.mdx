## Introduction

The Spark application structure is setup to give a consistant, organized project structure for your web application. 

Because Spark provides a defined structure for you, there are no suprises when starting work on new or existing project.

However, you are still free to create classes wherever you'd like if you choose to.

## Application
The `Application` directory contains the core code of you application.

### Database
The `Database` directory contains your `DatabaseContext` and `Migrations` for EF Core.

### Events
The `Events` directory contains your event and listener classes. Events are used to alert other parts of your app that a given action has occurred. This provides great flexibility and decoupling.

### Jobs
The `Jobs` directory contains queueable jobs for your application. Jobs can be scheduled or added to a background queue.

### Mail
The `Mail` directory contains your mailable classes. Mailables are C# classes that represent a specific type of e-mail that you can send.

### Models
The `Models` directory contains your efcore model classes. Each database table for your application has a corresponding Model class that efcore will use to interact with that table.

### Services
The `Services` directory contains your services that can be Dependency Injected on startup. Services are typically used to abstract away business logic or database calls.

### Startup
The `Startup` directory contains Registration classes. These classes are where Sparks core services, auth, custom services, events, or jobs are registered to the DI container. Scheduled jobs can also be registered here.

## Assets
The `Assets` directory contains your Javascript and CSS assets.

## Pages
The `Pages` directory contains your Blazor pages and components. You can also register Minimal API routes here.

## Storage
The `Storage` directory contains your application logs if the Spark logger is setup to log to files. It also contains mail logs if your mailer is setup to log to files.

## wwwroot
The `wwwroot` directory contains your compiled CSS, images, and other frontend public dependancies.

## Tests
The `Test` directory contains an XUnit project for your unit and integration tests. This directory is opened as it's own project in your apps solution.
