## Introduction
Spark is a fullstack framework that extends ASP.NET and Blazor SSR. It comes with several frontend dependencies setup to make your life easier.

It also comes with HTMX installed. HTMX lets you use simple server side rendering while allowing you to have partial page reloads on navigation and form submissions.

## CSS
Spark projects come with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) installed via NPM.

If you need to write custom CSS, you can do so in the `Assets/Css/app.css` file.

If you need to customize Tailwind CSS configuration, you can do so in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

If you need to add custom CSS classes outside of the Tailwind library, you can do so by updating the `Assets/Css/app.css` file. This file is picked up by Vite, which prunes any unused Tailwind classes and bundles a minified CSS file for you.

## Javascript
Spark project come with HTMX installed for you

HTMX is a javascript library that super charges your HTML markup and allows you to do page navigation and form submissions with partial page reloads, giving your app a SPA like feel.

You can learn more about HTMX [here](https://htmx.org/).

## Bundling Assets
Spark uses Vite to bundle your CSS and JS for you. It provides fast build times and Hot Module Replacement during local development.

You will find a `vite.config.js` file that configures and loads Vite for you.

Spark also uses the [Vite.AspNetCore](https://github.com/Eptagone/Vite.AspNetCore) Nuget package. This auto starts a Vite server for you when developing locally so you don't have to start it manually.

Finally, Spark projects are also setup to build your assets for you whenever running a `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`. You can find thses build commands in your `.csproj` file in the `App` folder.

### Custom Javascript
If you need to write custom JavaScript, it is advised to do so in the `Assets/Js/app.js` file. This file is picked up by Vite, which then builds the minified Js file for you.
