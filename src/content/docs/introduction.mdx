Spark.NET is a full stack web application framework that embraces ASP.NET and Entity Framework fundamentals while extending their capabilities and adding new ones, enabling developers to build feature-rich web applications quickly. 

Our goal is to empower you to build exceptional monolithic, full stack web applications with ease.

Every Spark project comes with the following already configured for you:
- Authentication
- Mail
- Logging
- Events & Listeners
- Background Queues
- Scheduled Jobs

It also provides login, register, user dashboards, and user profile pages scaffolded and hooked into Spark's authentication services.

## An Enjoyable Developer Experience

Every Spark project comes with the same project structure, ensuring you know where everything is, whether it's your first time on a project or not.

Spark also provides a custom CLI [tool](/docs/spark-cli) to improve your developer experience. The Spark CLI helps you create new projects, models, database migrations, services and other project files with ease. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Spark.NET, follow our [installation guide](/docs/installation).
