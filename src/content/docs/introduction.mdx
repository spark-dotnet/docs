Spark.NET is a web application framework that embraces Blazor, ASP.NET and Entity Framework fundamentals while extending their capabilities and adding new ones, enabling developers to build feature-rich web applications quickly. 

Our goal is to empower you to build exceptional web applications with ease.

Every Spark project comes with the following already configured for you:
- Authentication
- Mail
- Logging
- Events & Listeners
- Background Queues
- Scheduled Jobs

It also provides login, register, user dashboards, and user profile pages scaffolded and hooked into Spark's authentication services.

## An Enjoyable Developer Experience

Every Spark project comes with the same project structure, ensuring you know where everything is, whether it's your first time on a project or not.

Spark also provides a custom CLI [tool](/docs/spark-cli) to improve your developer experience. The Spark CLI helps you create new projects, models, database migrations, services and other project files with ease. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Spark.NET, follow our [installation guide](/docs/installation).

## Roadmap
Spark is still in development. Below is our functionality roadmap. If there is something you want that isn't listed here, add it to our [discussions](https://github.com/spark-dotnet/framework/discussions) in our Github repo.
